As far as I know, all elements of this assignment have been completed successfully. I was unable to communicate with my partner, so I have analyzed Professor Chow's code. I am very grateful for this and the timeliness of his response. Additionally, the piazza post by "Charlie" on the "mongodb hack" was helpful in jogging my memory as to what was taught in class. This assignment took me about 3 hours to complete in total, and was quite fun.
