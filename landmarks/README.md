To the best of my knowledge, all aspects of the assignment have been correctly implemented. 
I talked a bit about the assignment with Zach Munro, he helped me with understanding string concatenation. Then, I helped Jingqi with the same concept. 
I also used code from the google maps api: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/ 
and got the haversine formula from stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript
I also heavily used the W3 schools website for learning the different properties of objects.
I've spent about 5 hours putting this together, maybe a little more, maybe a little bit less.
